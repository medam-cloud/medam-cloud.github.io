As metabolomics becomes increasingly prevalent, a growing number of metabolite
biomarkers are being identified in various diseases. However, the roles these
metabolites play in diseases and their mechanisms of action are still subjects
of ongoing exploration. MeDAM is designed to deduce potential roles of
under-researched metabolites linked to various diseases based on prior
knowledge from different aspects, which eventually paves the way for in-depth
future research.
