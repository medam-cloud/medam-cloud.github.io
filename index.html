  <h1>MeDAM: a web server for in-depth metabolite-disease association profiling through biomedical knowledge mining.</h1>
  <p>As metabolomics becomes increasingly prevalent, a growing number of metabolite biomarkers are being identified in various diseases. However, the roles these metabolites play in diseases and their mechanisms of action are still subjects of ongoing exploration. MeDAM is designed to deduce potential roles of under-researched metabolites linked to various diseases based on prior knowledge from different aspects, which eventually paves the way for in-depth future research.</p>
